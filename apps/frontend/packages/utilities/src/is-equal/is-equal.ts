/**
 * Performs a deep comparison between two values to determine if they are equivalent.
 *
 * This function works by comparing the values directly if they are not objects.
 * If they are objects, it compares their keys and their corresponding values.
 * If the values of a key are also objects, it recursively calls `isEqual` to compare them.
 *
 * Note: This function is a simplified version and may not cover all edge cases that lodash's `isEqual` function does.
 * For example, it does not handle comparisons for functions, DOM nodes, Maps, Sets, etc.
 * If you need to handle these cases, you might want to consider sticking with lodash's `isEqual` or another library that provides deep equality checks.
 *
 * @param {unknown} value - The first value to compare.
 * @param {unknown} other - The second value to compare.
 * @returns {boolean} - Returns `true` if the values are equivalent, else `false`.
